# file-system-simulator
Project Requirements:
1. File System Structure:
   - Design and implement a file system structure that supports file and directory management.
   - Each file should have a name, size, and content.
   - Each directory should have a name and contain files and subdirectories.

2. User Interface:
   - The program should display a menu with the following options:
     a) Create a file
     b) Create a directory
     c) Delete a file or directory
     d) List files and directories
     e) Read a file
     f) Write to a file
     g) Exit the program
   - The program should repeatedly prompt the user for a menu choice until the user chooses to exit.

3. File and Directory Operations:
   - Implement functions to create files and directories within the virtual file system.
   - Implement functions to delete files and directories from the virtual file system.
   - Implement a function to list the files and directories within a directory.
   - Implement functions to read the content of a file and write to a file.

4. Error Handling:
   - The program should handle errors gracefully, such as invalid file or directory names, attempting to read or write to a non-existent file, or any other potential issues.
   - Provide meaningful error messages to guide the user in case of errors.

5. User Navigation:
   - Allow users to navigate through directories and perform file operations within the appropriate directory context.
   - Implement functions to move between directories and display the current directory path.

6. Documentation:
   - Include comments in the code to explain the purpose and functionality of major sections of your program.
   - Provide a brief overview of the program's functionality in a README file, including instructions on how to compile and run the program.
